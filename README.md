## Tutorials/Guides

I followed Ben Awad's [Fullstack Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8&t=34930s)

Points I learned🤠:

- Got a new prespective to developing software. I really loved to know and understand how to study code and work with it when things don't seems to work your way.
- Studied a new stack and implemented it.
